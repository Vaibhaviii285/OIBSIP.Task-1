Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
Fraud detection is a critical application of data science used to identify suspicious or
unauthorized activities in financial transactions.  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using data preprocessing,
exploratory analysis, and machine learning techniques.

The goal is to build a reliable model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent
transactions while handling class imbalance and noisy data.
